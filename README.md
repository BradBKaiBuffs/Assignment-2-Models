Assignment 2 Models

For this assignment, I created three diagrams: ***Conceptual, Logical, and Physical***.

For Conceptual, all entities have a many to many relationship. This is illustrated in a Chen diagram.

The relationships are clearly illustrated to show how the tables will be connected. The relationships are as follows:
- Students enroll into Courses.
- Students select a major(s).
- Majors have requirements that need to be met.
- Requirements are fulfilled by Courses.

For Logical, the relationships are more transparent with the inclusion of primary and foreign keys.

For Physical, the foreign keys are introduced to illustrate the relationships.
